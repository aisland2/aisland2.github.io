## Playability
Swift gameplay and tight controls, moves like a dream, but can be a little hard to control.

# Bugs
Played through but didn't notice any particular glitches.
# Final Thoughts
The game is small, linear and only really good for 1 - 2 playthroughs, but it's fun to try and integrate combos as you go further and further into the game. Really nice stress reliever if I may say so.
