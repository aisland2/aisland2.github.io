The game has the player fight against a species called Lumes that attempt to destroy their bases due to their habitat being disrupted. Therefore, the player fights waves on waves of these beings as they gain points to buy towers to stop the Lumes from intercepting the building.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
The game has a weird sense of movement, and your shots almost feel a bit underwhelming, but the game plays rather solid despite that. and gives the elements of a Tower Defense game along with an FPS, making it a pseudo puzzle. This makes it interesting to play, especially with other members.
### Single/Multiplayer
You can play this game solo or with a crew if you'd wish. The more people you have, the better it is to keep the Lumes from raiding your bases.
### Controls
The controls are simplistic, I will be demonstrating the controls for keyboard/mouse (PC). During the build phase, you use the left mouse clicks to use the currency in the game for building and reinforcing your towers, and the right mouse click to sell towers, WASD to move around. In Battle mode, you move with WASD, and shoot with the left mouse button. The right mouse button triggers a weapon change, while moving the mouse also gives control of the camera.

# Bugs
I would have expected a bug while playing but the only ones I found were the Lumes ones.
# Final Thoughts
I am not too fond of shooters, and have only played a few in my life. But I do happen to appreciate Sanctum 2 for what it is, and I believe it is still a game of its own caliber, despite being strange and different from the norm. Personally, I think I'd only really play it with friends, but even that's a fun time in its own.
