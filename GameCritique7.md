Play Pac-Man in a more fast-paced score attack style, eating pellets to make fruit appear while grabbing the attention of as many ghosts as you can to eat them up while racing against the clock!

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Handles extremely well and doesn't resist movement.
### Single/Multiplayer
This game is a single player game, as most Pac-Man games are.
### Controls
Using controllers in general: Movement is done by pressing the D-Pad or by analog stick (whichever you prefer), if the player runs against a wall with no opening, they will emit sparks and go a bit faster. L1 and R1 allow the player to use bombs to send the ghosts back to the starting gate for a brief moment.

# Bugs
None that I could find.
# Final Thoughts
This game is a ball of fun, despite not being the original Pac-Man that everyone grows up with. It puts a new, competitive spin on a game that's already made people competitive to beat it. I know I'll always pick this game up and play awhile, if the chance arises.
