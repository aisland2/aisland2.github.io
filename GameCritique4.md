# Game Play Summary
## Playability
It takes time to get used to but has good playability. In Multiplayer, netcode can be a little wonky at times and not register enemy hits.
### Single/Multiplayer
Both single and multiplayer, but sticks with the single player elements.
### Controls
Game uses keyboard and mouse controls. The character can move by WASD (W does not have a function unless otherwise said), jump with Space, the mouse is used to interact with the world and the player reacts to where the mouse cursor is depending on if an item has an aim function (Example: If the player uses a javelin, they will aim towards the cursor's direction. This does not apply if the weapon does not have an aim function, like a sword.)

# Bugs
For some reason, an enemy chasing me got past the wall it hit on for awhile. It didn't happen again so I'm not sure what happened.

# Final Thoughts
The game is a fun adventure to go through once, despite being very slow in the beginning. Taking a planet to make your own house with your spread of creativity is a fun passtime for a sandbox game. It can be fun to play with others so long as the netcode doesn't freak out and ruin the mood. Otherwise, I'd play this game alot more than I have in the past.
