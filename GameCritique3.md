# Synopsis
A point and click adventure where you train a character to save a goddess from the chaos spreading in the world.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Very stable, so long as the server keeps up with the players.
### Single/Multiplayer
Multiplayer
### Controls
Can be played with keyboard/mouse or controller. For the keyboard, arrow keys move the players, z allows you to attack, c allows you to use your sub weapon, space to jump and your skills are assigned to hotkeys you assign. Targets can be clicked on or auto targeted by hitting tab, or clicking them. With a controller, you personalize how you want to play other than using the arrows for movements.

# Bugs
There was a pulley that couldn't recognize I was on it because I got on it late, pushing me back to the start of the pulley when it got me halfway through.

# Final Thoughts
Tree of Savior is an easy, but fun MMO. As simplistic as it is to swat at things, get a few levels from questing or farming, and continue on with your business, something about beating the enemies and having them exploding in light feels rewarding. It could be bear to have a few more interactive events, but otherwise it is well-maintained and an overall nice experience. I expect to continue playing it and have a strong character to help others with.
