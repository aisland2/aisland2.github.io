# Fireball Test Plan

# Summary
Testing of this game should ensure that inputs work correctly, the menus go to their designated areas, and the fireball does its primary applications such as:
* Being able to ignite and melt blocks, as well as making sure the "slam" function efficiently does its intended purpose (this requires a test on block types as well.).
* Assuring the fireball does not lag its inputs when pressed, and that the reset button complies.
* Testing that the endgoal (a torch) allows the player to end the stage.
* Making sure the Chain Size counter doesn't obscure the player.

# Environment/User Community
We will be testing on a PS2 in the test room near the classroom. This game will stick to the PS2 throughout its lifespan.

# Test Objectives
* Pressing X to jump without a delay.
* Pressing Square or Circle to slam onto the ground and explode.
* Pressing Triangle to allow top down view whilst jumping.
* Assuring that holding Select for 0.5 seconds to reset the level.
* Pressing L1 to strafe left and L2 to turn left.
* Pressing R1 to strafe right and R2 to turn right.
* Igniting each block to make sure which burn and which melt properly.
* Getting to the torch and assuring that the player gains the "win" state.
* Playing a level with a giant chain possibility to check for certain Chain will not obscure the player's view.

# Acceptance Criteria
I expect about 5 defects will take place, but they will be minor and acceptable.
