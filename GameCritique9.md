# Synopsis
A small hero goes through a number of stages to try and help out the villagers of Pompom.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
The game is automated with a few buttons for skills, so you pretty much only click skills and potions when you need them, or let the game do it for you.

### Single/Multiplayer
The game is a single player game and only for the player to enjoy.

### Controls
Legit all the player does is watch the screen and wait until a skill is used. Tap the skill to use it, or tap the potion to heal. Everything else is automated.

# Bugs
I tested this both with wifi and on 4G, but for some reason, in the menus (specifically the blacksmith's shop) button presses are laggy and dont respond for awhile. Other than that, I didnt see anything else.
# Final Thoughts
The game's cute but it's not really all that great. I enjoy RPGs, but not so much on a mobile scale. Maybe if I play it a bit longer something else will click, but otherwise I need to pass on this.
